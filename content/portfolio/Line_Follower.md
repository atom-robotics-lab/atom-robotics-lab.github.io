This project is a simulation of a Line Following Robot based on Image Processing using real time camera view from the robot. The sim uses our in-house mobile base platform, MR ROBOT.
Color Detection & Masking techniques are used to turn the colored camera feed into a black and white image to find the midpoint of the line and follow along with it. It also uses a Proportional Controller for controlling the robot's motion.
The tech stacks used in this project include Python, ROS, OpenCV and Gazebo
