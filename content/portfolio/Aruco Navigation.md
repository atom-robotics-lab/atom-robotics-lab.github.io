Presenting to you another one of our Computer Vision-based projects: Aruco Navigation
This project aims to make our self-made mobile base MR_ROBOT navigate through the simulation world using Aruco Markers.

Aruco Markers are binary square markers used for camera pose estimation. Each aruco marker has a unique ID, 
which can be mapped to the direction in which the bot should travel after detecting it.

This project makes use of ROS, Python, Gazebo and OpenCV. It also uses a Proportional Controller.
