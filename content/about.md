- A.T.O.M stands for Advanced Techtronix Organization of MAIT. Here we are trying to build a Society | Community around making more Intelligent and Advanced robots by introducing technologies like ROS (Robot Operating System), CAD (Computer Aided Design), Embedded Systems/IOT, Software Engineering etc.

- Many robotics societies all around never go beyond building line followers and wall followers. Though they are the basics and an integral part of robotics and we will also make them, we also want to go way beyond that and introduce you to industrial robotics through the idea of project based learning by making amazing projects. From room cleaning roombas to self driving mobile UGVs to industrial robotic arms.

- No one is perfect! We are not special either. There are many things that we want to learn from ya’ll as much as we can and in return try to give back as much as we can. That’s how we build a community.


- Don’t know about Hardware? Doesn’t matter. Robotics requires minds from all over engineering. We DON’T CARE about your marks, your age, your year or your branch. We care that you want to learn, teach, grow and make things.
All we need is a strong will power to get stuff done. That’s it

# Abstract

The world is heading towards the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the introduction of Robotics & AI. Intelligent & Advanced robots are now being used everywhere to either assist humans or execute tasks that otherwise won’t be possible by humans due to some limitations. 
Open source technologies like Gazebo Robotics Simulator, ROS ([Robot Operating System](https://atom-robotics-lab.github.io/wiki/ros/ros.html)) have expanded the horizons of robotics and allowed students & researchers to dive into the depths of intelligent industrial/household robotics. These technologies provide access to state of the art robotic algorithms & technologies allowing students to gain hands-on experience.

# Vision

As engineering students, we are highly interested & excited by these technologies. Robotics & AI intrigue us to become a part of this movement on the brink of innovation by exploring modern technologies like ROS.
